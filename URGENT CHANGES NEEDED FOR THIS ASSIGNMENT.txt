Class throws sme exception for different errors; change it to:
1- throw different exceptions OR
2- check message thrown to distinguish between the two errors (see class NewTelephoneCompanyTest_BBT_WITH_MESSAGECHECKING.java inside package)

ou could use the @Rule annotation with ExpectedException, like this:

@Rule
public ExpectedException expectedEx = ExpectedException.none();

@Test
public void shouldThrowRuntimeExceptionWhenEmployeeIDisNull() throws Exception {
    expectedEx.expect(RuntimeException.class);
    expectedEx.expectMessage("Employee ID is null");
    // do something that should throw the exception...
}
